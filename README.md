# BlackLittermanBayesian
This is a simple implementation of Black Litterman Bayesian portfolio optimization based on SP500 stocks
(data is missing because i haven't figured out if i should be allowed to share the data i had)

It uses a optimal prior based on historical data and posterior is maintained and updated as new data comes in.
For some brief introduction of BLB and optimal prior see my [blog post](https://numerairxxx.github.io/posts/2019-02-11-Bayesian-Struggles-Black-Litterman-Bayes-Walkthrough-Part-1)
